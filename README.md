# TraceReconstruction-v2
Creation of a simple trace reconstruction program for physical purposes. From a Monte Carlo simulation a list of rectilinear trace are created and made interact with a detector to generate the point of interaction. After being adequately saved using a proper format the Hought transformation is used on GPU to reconstruct the traces. The reconstructed traces are then compared to the originals.
